# egg58

![photo](images/egg58.jpg)

The egg58 is a staggered-column, split, low-profile keyboard with 58 keys and per-key RGB. The PCB is reversible (i.e. the same part is used for both hands). This repository contains its design files.

## Layout

The egg58 was designed to remain fairly close in layout to an ANSI 60% keyboard, but with a reduced number of keys and
minimal thumb clusters.

This is a suggested layout, but obviously it is customizable.

## Original variant

The original (wired) keyboard design files can be found in directory [egg58v2](egg58v2).

### Materials

- 2x PCB (from this repo)
- 2x switchplate (from this repo)
- 2x Pro Micro or Elite-C
- 2x 4.7K through hole resistors (for I2C option)
- 2x 3.5mm TRRS jack (PJ-320A)
- 58 Choc sockets
- 58 Choc switches (Choc V1 only)
- 58 diodes (1N4148 or similar, throughhole or SOD123)
- 58 SK6812 Mini-E LEDs
- 1x TRRS cable

### Build instructions

On the back of each board:

- Install LEDs such that the notched corner aligns with the indicator on the silkscreen.
  - Be aware that the orientation of the LEDs changes each row.
- Install diodes, such that the cathode (the side with the line) points toward the square holes (upward). 
  - If using through-hole diodes with the FR4 switchplate, ensure that the leads are trimmed very short on the front, otherwise they may scratch through the switchplate solder mask and short out.
- Install sockets.
- If I2C is being used, install the two resistors beneath the location for the TRRS. (They can be placed on the front instead if desired.)
  - Recommended to use either 2x 4.7K on a single hand, or 4x 10K on both hands.
  - The values are fairly flexible, as long as the total resistance on each line is between 2.2K-10K.
- Solder the two jumpers to select serial/I2C and Elite-C/Pro Micro.
  - The EliteC/ProMicro jumper selects the position of the VBUS/RAW pin, to supply 5v to the LEDs and across the TRRS cable. On the Elite-C, the RAW pin is replaced with an extra I/O pin (B0) and an extra VBUS pin is added above it. Select EliteC in this case, or ProMicro for all others.
  - The Serial/I2C jumper selects which data pin is attached to the TRRS jack. The firmware uses I2C by default, but select Serial if you have customized it.
  - Each jumper should have one "outer" pad soldered to the inner pad. See [Issue #4](https://github.com/eggsworks/egg58/issues/4) for further explanation and a diagram.

On the front:

- Install TRRS.
- Install MCU (preferably in a socket).

Mount the switchplate to the PCB with 5x M2 screws. Nylon screws are recommended. A spacer is recommended between the two layers. Finally, install switches in the sockets.

### Firmware

My [fork of QMK](https://github.com/tmick0/qmk_firmware/tree/egg58/keyboards/egg58) contains default configuration and a keymap for the board.

The configuration will need to be changed if using soft serial instead of I2C, or if your microcontrollers do not use the DFU bootloader.

### Changelog

#### Revision 2.1 - 2023-04-01

- Add support for VBUS from Elite-C

#### Revision 2.0 - 2022-03-04

- Original Chocs are used rather than Choc v2
- There is an option to use soft serial instead of I2C for the bridge transport
- The Elite-C microcontroller is now supported in addition to the Pro Micro
- The LEDs are now north-facing (since that is more suitable for the only shine-through caps for Choc currently available)
- The thumb cluster is now designed for 2x 1.5u instead of one 1.5u and one 2u key
- Keys now use Choc spacing instead of MX (be aware of this when purchasing keycaps)

## Wireless variant

A simplified version designed to be used with ZMK is available in the [egg58bt](egg58bt) directory. This version has no RGB and uses BLE for both connectivity to the host and the split transport.

### Materials

- 2x PCB (from this repo)
- 2x switchplate (from this repo)
- 2x nice!nano microcontrollers
- 58 Choc sockets
- 58 Choc switches (Choc V1 only)
- 58 diodes (1N4148 or similar, throughhole or SOD123)

### Build instructions

Construction is the same as the original variant above, just skip the steps related to the split transport and LEDs.

### Firmware

ZMK support is available from my [zmk-config](https://github.com/tmick0/zmk-config) repo.

### Changelog

#### 2022-02-20

- Created iwreless variant

## Accessories

A 3D-printable case compatible with both the original and wireless boards can be found in [egg58v2 case](egg58v2%20case).

A model for a wrist rest is also available in [egg58v2 wrist rest](egg58v2%20wrist%20rest).
