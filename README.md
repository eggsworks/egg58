# egg58

The egg58 is a staggered-column, split, low-profile keyboard with 58 keys and per-key RGB. The PCB is reversible (i.e. the same part can be used for either hand). This repository contains its design files.

## Status

The egg58v2 is a major redesign from the first revision and the PCB included here is not yet complete.

Some changes from the first version include:
- Original Chocs are used rather than Choc v2
- Serial is used for the bridge transport instead of I2C
- The Elite-C microcontroller is now supported
- Routing should be more optimized than the original
- Various silkscreen errors have been fixed
